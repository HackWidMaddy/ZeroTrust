# ZeroTrust: Advanced Red Team C2 Framework

## 📋 Executive Summary

**ZeroTrust** (UI name: **ZeroTrace**) is a sophisticated command-and-control (C2) framework engineered for educational red teaming simulations and advanced persistent threat (APT) research. The platform combines **covert channel communication**, **federated learning-based command delivery**, and **Living-off-the-Land Binaries (LOLBINs)** to demonstrate advanced threat methodologies while maintaining educational integrity and security research compliance.

---

## 🎯 Core Functionality

### 1. **Covert Channel-Based Communication**

ZeroTrust implements stealth communication pathways that disguise malicious traffic as legitimate ML framework operations:

- **Traffic Masking**: Commands transmitted within federated learning model weight vectors
- **CryptoJS Encryption**: AES-encrypted command payloads preventing interception
- **Detection Evasion**: Network patterns replicate legitimate distributed ML communications
- **Multi-layer Abstraction**: Communication protocol appears benign to traditional network monitors

**How It Works:**
```
Operator Command → AI Translation → Encryption → 
Weight Embedding → Bot Retrieval → Command Execution → 
Result Exfiltration → Next Federated Round
```

### 2. **Living-off-the-Land Binaries (LOLBINs) as Payload Delivery**

ZeroTrust leverages system-native executables to execute reconnaissance commands without downloading malicious binaries:

**Key LOLBINs Used:**

| LOLBIN | Purpose | Example Command |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **PowerShell** | Command execution & data exfiltration | `Get-Process`, `netstat -an` |
| **CMD.exe** | Legacy command execution | Directory enumeration, system info |
| **Get-WmiObject** | System reconnaissance | Hardware inventory, installed software |
| **Get-ScheduledTask** | Persistence detection | Identify scheduled backdoors |
| **Get-ChildItem** | File system enumeration | Directory listing, hidden files |

**Advantages:**
- No malware signatures (legitimate system binaries)
- Enabled by default on all Windows systems
- Execution logged under normal system operations
- Reduced detection by antivirus/EDR solutions

### 3. **Federated Learning Protocol for C2 Communication**

The framework uses distributed machine learning rounds as a covert C2 channel:

**Federated Learning Workflow:**
1. **Round Initialization**: Coordinator announces active ML round
2. **Weight Distribution**: Global model weights (containing embedded commands) sent to bots
3. **Local Execution**: Bots execute embedded commands during "training"
4. **Update Submission**: Bot returns model updates + command output as training gradients
5. **Aggregation**: Coordinator extracts results and prepares next round
6. **Command Loop**: Process repeats for persistent C2 communication

**Key Advantage**: ML traffic is legitimate and expected in enterprise networks, making it virtually undetectable.

### 4. **AI-Powered Natural Language Command Translation**

The dashboard leverages **Groq API (GPT-OSS-120B)** to automatically generate Windows commands:

- **Input**: Natural language operational requirements ("show running processes")
- **Processing**: AI translates to optimal PowerShell/CMD syntax
- **Output**: Auto-execution on selected bot endpoints
- **Benefit**: Operators don't require command-line expertise

**Example Translation:**
```
Operator Query: "show all network connections"
    ↓
AI Processing: GPT-OSS-120B generates optimal command
    ↓
Generated Command: netstat -an | findstr ESTABLISHED
    ↓
Execution: Embedded in federated learning weight vector
    ↓
Result: Network reconnaissance data returned to dashboard
```

## 🔐 Security Features & Covert Techniques

### Detection Evasion Mechanisms

**1. Encryption & Obfuscation**
- CryptoJS AES-256 encryption for all command payloads
- Weight obfuscation: Commands encoded within ML model gradients
- Traffic normalization: C2 communications appear as legitimate federated learning

**2. Behavioral Mimicry**
- Network patterns replicate legitimate ML frameworks (Flower, TensorFlow Federated)
- Timing randomization: Configurable polling intervals prevent pattern detection
- Content blending: Commands disguised within training data exchanges

**3. Living-off-the-Land Execution**
- No external binary downloads
- Uses native Windows executables (PowerShell, WMI, CMD)
- Execution logged as standard system operations
- Antivirus signature evasion (system binaries are trusted)

**4. Authentication & Session Management**
- Cookie-based session tokens (Next.js middleware)
- Protected routes requiring valid authentication
- API endpoint access control via custom headers
- Bot client ID verification in federated protocol

## 🛡️ Anti-Prevention & Defense Mechanisms

### Process Monitoring & Termination Defense

To demonstrate the arms race between offensive and defensive security, ZeroTrust includes countermeasures against common EDR prevention techniques:

**Implementation: kill-notepad.ps1 (EDR Evasion Model)**

This script demonstrates how malware bypasses process-level defenses:

```powershell
# Multi-layered defense evasion approach

# 1. PRIVILEGE ESCALATION CHECK
$principal = New-Object Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal([Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent())
if (-not $principal.IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator)) {
  return
}

# 2. EXECUTION WITH ADMIN CONTEXT
# Requires Administrator privileges to avoid detection by EDR

# 3. EVENT-DRIVEN MONITORING (WMI Events)
Register-WmiEvent -Class Win32_ProcessStartTrace -SourceIdentifier NotepadKiller -Action {
  # Real-time process creation events bypass traditional monitoring
}

# 4. POLLING FALLBACK MECHANISM
while ($true) {
  Get-Process -Name notepad -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
  # Continuous monitoring ensures persistence even if WMI events fail
}

# 5. STEALTH EXECUTION
Start-Job { Stop-Process -Id $id -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue }
# Jobs execute in separate PowerShell instances, bypassing parent process monitoring
```

**Defense Techniques Demonstrated:**

| Technique | Purpose | EDR Bypass |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Admin Context Execution** | Terminate protected processes | Elevated privileges bypass user-mode hooks |
| **WMI Event Subscription** | Real-time process monitoring | WMI events logged differently than direct calls |
| **Job-based Execution** | Spawn independent PowerShell instances | Parent-child relationship breaking |
| **Polling Fallback** | Redundant mechanism if WMI fails | Defensive layering for reliability |
| **Error Suppression** | Silent failure without alerts | Stealth operation preventing detection |

**Security Research Value:**
- Demonstrates how malware maintains persistence against process termination
- Shows layered defense evasion (WMI + polling + job execution)
- Illustrates EDR limitations in handling native PowerShell operations
- Educational reference for blue team detection bypasses
